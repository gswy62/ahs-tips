    <p>This is a website dedicated to helping out future
        American Heritage students with their classes. Teachers
        often run their classes in very different ways, so this
        website intends to offer some guidance on approaching these
        different courses in the best possible manner.</p>
    
    <p>Here are a few general tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>studying the day of an assessment often works</li>
        <li>go to extra help!</li>
        <li>the textbook is your best friend</li>
        <li>use Harys Dalvi's 
            <a href="https://crackalamoo.github.io/grader/">grade calculator</a></li>
